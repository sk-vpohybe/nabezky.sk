OG Mailinglist - Turns Drupal into a multi-group email list.


OG Mailinglist allows users to start new posts by email and post comments on
existing discussions by simply replying to emails.  You get the best of both
worlds: a browser-based discussion site and an email-based list.


REQUIREMENTS

There are two ways of installing this module. First, the easier method,
is to use Mailgun's email service to send and receive emails. OG
Mailinglist ships with a sub-module which provides the necessary
integration.

The second option is to setup up your own email server. For this you'll
need:

* A Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) - This module plugs directly into your MTA so
  emails can be handled immediately upon receipt.  Most modules use POP
  mailboxes, and while this adds portability, it adds a delay to the system.
  With the method this modules uses, the MTA triggers the module as part of its
  normal email delivery process.

Right now the only fully supported MTAs are Exim, QMail and Postfix. If you use
another MTA, look in the issue queue for issues on other MTAs and offer help or
start a new one.

For both methods, OG Mailinglist also requires,

* Organic Groups - This module assumes you are using a group-oriented web site.
  This module allows for one list per group.

* PHPMailer 5

* The PHP libraries mimeDecode and Curl.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

* The module should (generally) be uploaded to the sites/all/modules/ directory.
* See http://drupal.org/getting-started/install-contrib/modules for more help in
* installing Drupal contrib modules.

* Download and unpack the PHPMailer 5.x then move the library to
* og_mailinglist/phpmailer or to libraries/phpmailer if you use the libraries
* module - https://github.com/KyleAMathews/phpmailer/tarball/master

NOTE: We're using a slightly forked version of PHPMailer. OG Mailinglist
*won't work* with a standard version of PHPMailer. Our bug report in the
PHPMailer issue queue has sat untouched for over a year so we're forced
to go with our forked version of the library. The changes are quite
minor however and won't interfer with other uses of PHPMailer by your
Drupal installation.

* Install the PHP library mimeDecode. Use the command listed below for your OS:
*
*   Debian/Ubuntu:           apt-get install php-mail-mimedecode
*   Fedora/RHEL/CentOS:      yum -y install php-pear-Mail-mimeDecode
*
* You can also download the library directly from:
*   http://pear.php.net/package/Mail_mimeDecode
* and place the library (mimeDecode.php) either in a subdirectory to og_mailinglist
* (path_to_modules/og_mailinglist/mimeDecode) or to the libraries folder. Note that
* this installation step is only necessary if you want members of your site to be
* able to send email to the site to start or respond to posts. If all posting will
* happen directly on the site, installing mimeDecode is unnecessary.

* Install the PHP library Curl (if it's not already installed. Many setups come
* preinstalled with Curl support.). Use the command listed below for your OS:
*
*   Debian/Ubuntu:           apt-get install php5-curl
*   Fedora/RHEL/CentOS:      yum -y install php-pear-Net-Curl

* Go to the Modules page in Drupal and enable the module (like normal).  After
* saving, navigate to admin/og/og_mailinglist and configure per your server
* setup.

* After creating a content type for group content you have to go to
* admin/config/group/mailinglist/content_types page and save,
* otherwise your content will be posted as stories, which might give errors.

* If you're not using Mailgun, to setup og_mailinglist for incoming email, follow
* the installation instructions for your Mail Transfer Agent in the INSTALL.txt file
* found in its subdirectory (e.g. exim_og_mailinglist).

* To hide quoted parts of email messages, enable the provided input filter "Hide
* quoted text from comments created via email" at admin/settings/filter and
* rearrange the filters to set this one first. Note, that for this to work, your
* input filter(s) will need to allow both the <span> and <div> HTML tags.

* Congratulations.  You're running og_mailinglist!

FAQ
Q: I have an existing OG site that I want to install OG Mailinglist on but I
don't want people to be subscribed to the mailinglist right away when I install
the module. How do I do this?
A: Once the OG Mailinglist is installed, you can
set the default subscription setting for people joining a group on the OG
Mailinglist admin page. But as OG Mailinglist automatically generates
subscriptions for existing users on install, to change the default subscription
to "no email" you'll need to change a bit of code. Open the
og_mailinglist_api.inc file and find the
og_mailinglist_save_group_subscriptions() function. Then for the insert
function, change 'email' to 'no email'. See http://drupal.org/node/916934 for
more on this.

Q: Users want to be able to post from email accounts other than the one they
registered with on the site, is this possible?
A: Yes! OG Mailinglist supports
the Mailalias module - http://drupal.org/project/mailalias. Install this on your
site and users will be able to add additional email addresses they'd like to
post from.

Q: I can't get mimeDecode to install or work.
A: mimeDecode depends on PHP PEAR, which should be installed on any
recent install of PHP but if you get weird errors, this might be something
worth checking.

Q: I can't get this module to work with Drupal Commons for incoming
email.
A: Drupal commons apparently by default limits access to the site to
logged-in users. OG Mailinglist receives incoming emails at the url
/og_mailinglist. This url needs to be set so anonymous users can access
it. See http://drupal.org/node/1569730
